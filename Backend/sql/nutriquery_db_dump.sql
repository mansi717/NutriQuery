Drain and set aside. Preheat broiler.\nHeat olive oil in a large skillet. Saute onion and garlic over medium high heat for 2-3 minutes, stirring so the garlic doesn’t burn. Add crushed tomatoes and fresh tomatoes. Season with salt and pepper and simmer for 5-10 minutes or until mixture thickens slightly. Add half of the basil and stir for 1 minute. Remove from heat and add to the pasta. Pour in tomato sauce and stir to combine (and you can add more sauce until it’s saucy enough for you if you). Pour into a baking dish or skillet.\nTop with shredded cheese and place under broiler for 5-8 minutes or until cheese is melted and bubbly.

Place the breadcrumbs in a shallow bowl with 2 tablespoons of Parmesan cheese and set aside.\nPrep the filling: Chop the spinach and saute it with the garlic and just a drizzle of olive oil for 2-3 minutes or until just barely wilted. Combine the sauteed spinach with the ricotta, Parmesan cheese, and 2-3 tablespoons of the egg whites. Place the remaining egg whites in a separate shallow bowl and set aside.\nAssemble the chicken: Oil the bottom of a large baking dish and preheat the oven to 450 degrees. Place one piece of chicken on a flat working surface. Put a spoonful of ricotta-spinach filling right in the middle and roll the chicken up so that the edges meet to form a “seam”. Dip the entire chicken roll in egg whites, and then roll it in the breadcrumbs. Place in a baking dish, seam side down. Repeat for the remaining 7 pieces of chicken. Bake for 25 minutes.\nFinishing touches: After 25 minutes, the chicken should be cooked through (white on the inside) and browned on the top. Cover the chicken with the marinara sauce and slices of fresh Mozzarella. Bake for another 3-5 minutes or until cheese is melting. Sprinkle with fresh basil.','1 hour','https://pinchofyum.com/wp-content/uploads/baked-mozzarella-chicken-rolls-192-Square-183x183.jpg','2025-07-29',60),(95,'Baked Rigatoni with Spinach, Provolone, and Turkey','Mince the onions and garlic. Combine in a small bowl and set aside.\nBring the vegetable broth to a boil; add half of the onion/garlic mixture and the prepared squash.

Transfer the cooked squash combo with 1/2 cup of the vegetable broth from the pot to a blender and puree until smooth, adding salt, pepper, and dried oregano to taste. Stir in cream and set aside.\nBrown the turkey over medium high heat with the remaining onion/garlic mixture. Season generously with salt, pepper, and oregano. Drain out any excess liquid so that the meat will get a browned, almost crispy look.\nCook the rigatoni in a large pot. Undercook the pasta slightly to avoid mushy noodles – I boiled mine for about 6 minutes. Drain the water; add the sauce, sausage, and spinach to the pot with the noodles. Stir until combined. Transfer to a large baking dish (any shape), stopping half way to add a layer of cheese (about 1/2 cup of cheese). Pour remaining pasta mixture in and sprinkle the remaining 1/2 cup of cheese on top.

Line a baking sheet with parchment. Add the potatoes to the pan and toss with a little bit of olive oil, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Roast for 25 minutes until lightly browned and delicious.\nMake the Life-Changingly Delicious Sauce:While the potatoes are roasting, make your sauce. Melt the butter over medium low heat (I usually start with 6 tablespoons and add the last two if needed once the sauce is cooked). Add the garlic, shallot, and thyme sprigs; sauté for 3-5 minutes until soft and fragrant. Add broth and cream; bring to a low simmer. Let the sauce hang out over low heat until it starts to thicken enough to coat the back of a spoon. Remove the thyme sprigs. Whisk in the lemon juice, stir in the herbs, and season with salt and pepper. Give it a taste. Yes, you’re in heaven now.\nBake the Salmon and Broccoli:Add the broccoli and the salmon to the potato pan (keeping the potatoes on there). Toss or brush with a little more oil, salt, and pepper. Bake for another 10-15 minutes, until the salmon is fully cooked – I like it to be *just* past the point of translucent where it flakes apart very easily but isn’t dried out.\nYou’re Done:Serve salmon, potatoes, and broccoli with big spoonfuls of sauce, more herbs, and more lemon wedges.

Add the tomatoes, garlic, salt, red pepper flakes, and broth; simmer until the sauce reduces and gets a little darker in color, about 10 minutes.\nGrill the sourdough:While the sauce simmers, grill your sourdough. Melt the butter, brush it on the bread, and grill in a pan (ideally a grill pan) until crispy and golden brown. Wrap in foil and keep warm in the oven.\nAdd the shrimp:Add the shrimp into the tomato sauce in a single layer. The shrimp will cook right in the sauce – keep on the heat for about 5 minutes, flipping the shrimp once, until the shrimp are no longer translucent.\nBroil:Turn the broiler on. Sprinkle feta on top. Transfer to the oven and broil for 5 minutes or until the feta is browned. Serve with a sprinkling of fresh parsley.

Add the oil and the sausage; break apart with a wooden spoon and brown until it’s got some nice color. Transfer to a bowl and drain out any of the oil that you don’t want (I usually drain off about a tablespoon, leaving a tablespoon in the pan).\nSauté the veggies:If you’ve got some browning on the bottom of your pan – great. Add the veggies and they should start to pull up some of that yummy brown flavor. Add the fennel seeds. Cook until the veggies are fragrant and soft – you can add a bit of salt or oil if you’re feeling chefy. Then add the sausage back in.\nAdd everything else:Add your tomato sauce, your tortellini, and 1 cup of broth. The pan will be full. Let it come to a low simmer and cook for 5 minutes or so to cook the tortellini. If you need more liquid to cook the tortellini, go ahead and add some or all of the remaining broth. Sometimes I just pop a lid on and leave it for a while on low heat.\nSpinach and cheese:Give it a taste – if you used canned tomatoes instead of a jar of sauce, it will probably need some salt. Add the spinach and stir it in until it wilts. Top the whole thing with the mozzarella cheese and pop it into the oven at 375 for 8-10 minutes, or until the cheese is nice and melty.\nFinish:Sprinkle some grated parm on top along with some chopped parsley, and dunk into that baby with some chunks ofgarlic bread.

If they are still too long to fit inside your lumpia wrappers, cut the ends off or cut them in half again. Dip your fingers in water and run them along the edge of the lumpia wrapper to make them easier to fold. Fold the top and bottom over the banana, and then roll it sideways, sealing the banana inside and using a little more water to make the wrapper stick together.\nHeat the oil in a large skillet or frying pan over low heat.

Line a baking sheet with foil. Alternatively, you can set it to 500 degrees on the broil setting for medium rare with a yummy crispy top – the risk here is that you have to watch closely so it doesn’t burn the sugar. If taking this route, make sure one of the oven racks is close-ish to the top, about 6 inches or so.\nSalmon:Mix the spices and the olive oil to make a paste. Place the salmon skin side down on the baking sheet. Rub the paste liberally over the top part of the salmon.

Add the steak pieces – sear them so that they get nice and browned on all sides, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a plate. Wipe excess grease out of the pan; add the simmer sauce from step one to the pan. While it simmers, measure the spices and add them to the pan. Stir fry until very fragrant, about 3 minutes.

Cover and simmer gently for 1 hour.\nPrepare the rice:While the beef is simmering (yum!) soak the rice in cold water and then rinse thoroughly to remove the starch – this helps it from being too sticky later on.

When it’s done resting, give it a good stir and add a bit more water if you want it less sweet.

Transfer to a baking sheet, pizza pan, or baking stone. Freeze the other piece of dough for a future pizza.\nSpread the pizza with the kale pesto (you might not need 1/2 cup depending on how thick your pesto is – just spread it until you get a thin layer on each pizza). Arrange the sun dried tomatoes in an even layer over the pesto and top with cheese. Make three or four small wells in the cheese to make room for the eggs. Crack the eggs and arrange them (raw) among the top cheese layer.\nBake the pizza on the highest rack for 6-10 minutes, until the crust is baked, the cheese is melted and bubbly, and the eggs are cooked to your liking (I like the yolks to be soft).

Add the ground beef to the hot pan, seasoning side down (see video for how I did this straight from package). Resist the urge to break it up immediately –leave it undisturbedfor several minutes to get a nice browned crust. The fat will start to render and it should start to develop some browning.\nTo finish the beef:Sprinkle the exposed side with the other teaspoon of seasoning.

Stir in the flour by hand just until incorporated. It will be sticky but should come together in a very soft dough. Set aside in a warm place (I cover mine with a clean, warm, barely-wet kitchen towel) and let rise for about 2 hours. At this point it’s going to be too sticky to handle, so it needs to chill in the fridge for a while – I usually leave mine overnight.\nFor the filling:Mix filling ingredients together until incorporated. The raspberries will break down and that’s perfect.\nAssembly Step 1:Split the dough in half and generously flour the outside of each half so you can handle it without it sticking. Gently roll or press on a well-floured surface to form a big rectangle about 1/4 inch thick. I usually let the natural shape of the dough dictate the exact dimensions rather than try to press it and stretch it into something that it doesn’t want to do. If it starts fighting you and pulling back at the edges, it’s probably overworked – just let it sit and relax again for 30 minutes or so. Once you have a rectangle that feels about right in terms of thickness, cut the dough from the edges to create straight edges.\nAssembly Step 2:For each tea ring, spread a thin layer of the cream cheese mixture (about half of the cream cheese mixture per half of the dough) onto the dough, going almost to the edges. Starting at the longer side, roll the dough up very gently to form a long log-shaped roll.\nAssembly Step 2:Pull the log gently to make it a little longer and thinner – this makes it easier to assemble in a circle. Cut the uneven ends off with a wet knife so you have two clean ends that will stick together when formed into a circle. Transfer to a baking sheet and form into a circle, seam side down, gently pinching the cut ends together to secure the circle. Chill in the freezer for 30 minutes or so (this just helps it stay together and makes it easier to cut without losing its shape).\nAssembly Step 4:Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Remove the chilled dough and cut 1-inch sections around the circle, going almost all the way through but not quite. Fan out each of the sections and push it flat. <–At this point you might feel like it looks terrible and you’ve failed miserably. Hang with it. Keep pressing it, adjusting it, gently arranging it – it will work! So much magic happens once you bake it and top it with the glaze.\nBaking:Brush with one whisked egg yolk + 1 teaspoon milk (optional but pretty). Bake for 20 minutes or longer until the top is golden brown and the inside is just barely cooked through (I prefer underbaking since overbaking will dry it out).\nTopping:Whisk the powdered sugar and the milk together.

Use a fine mesh strainer to dust the bottom of your pan with cocoa powder. This helps absorb excess moisture from the espresso so it doesn’t get too wet.\nLayer:Dip ladyfingers very briefly in the espresso; turn to coat (I give a slow count of 3 while flipping each one – back side, front side, back side again and remove). You don’t want these in the espresso for a very long time or the whole thing will fall apart. Ladyfingers should cover the bottom of the pan.

Line a 9-inch (2.5 L) square pan (or an 8-inch/2 L pan for a slightly thicker bar) with parchment paper, leaving some overhang, which will make it easy to lift out the bars later.\nIn a food processor, combine the sunflower seeds, oats, and salt and process until you have a coarse flour.\nIn a small pot, melt the oil over low heat. Remove from the heat and whisk in the maple syrup, brown rice syrup, and sunflower seed butter until combined. Pour the wet mixture on top of the oat mixture in the food processor and process until the mixture comes together, 10 to 15 seconds. The dough should feel quite heavy and oily, and there shouldn’t be any dry patches. If there are, process for 5 seconds more. If for some reason it’s still too dry, try adding water, a teaspoon (5 mL) at a time, and processing again until it comes together.\nSet aside 1¼ cups (300 mL) of the oat mixture for the topping. Crumble the remaining oat mixture over the base of the prepared pan in an even layer. Starting at the center, push down with your fingers (you can lightly wet them if they stick) to spread out and pack down the crust. Press the dough down tightly. Even out the edges with your fingertips. Prick the crust with the tines of a fork 9 times to allow steam to escape.\nPrebake the crust for 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool for 5 minutes. (If the crust puffed up while baking, gently press down on it to release the air.) Spread the jam in an even layer over the crust. Crumble the reserved 1¼ cups (300 mL) oat mixture evenly over the jam.\nBake, uncovered, for 14 to 18 minutes more, until the topping is lightly firm to the touch. The topping will not turn golden in color; it will remain the same shade as it was before baking. Let cool in the pan on a cooling rack for 45 to 60 minutes, then transfer the pan to the freezer for 30 minutes until completely cool. Lift out the slab and slice it into squares or bars. Leftovers can be stored in an airtight container in the fridge for several days, or wrapped up and stored in the freezer for 4 to 5 weeks.','50 minutes','https://pinchofyum.com/wp-content/uploads/Jam-Bars-Recipe-183x183.jpg','2025-07-29',50),(1000,'Strawberry Shortcake Yogurt Bowls','Granola:Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

(I use this mini chopper for the vast majority of my sauces because it’s nice and compact!)\nBlend until you get your desired consistency – I usually go for an almost-completely-smooth texture that is flecked with small bits of herbs.','10 minutes','https://pinchofyum.com/wp-content/uploads/Basil-Sauce-2.jpg','2025-07-29',10),(1100,'Vietnamese-Inspired Chicken Salad with Rice Noodles','DRESSING: Thinly slice the serranos and set aside. Pulse all the remaining dressing ingredients in a food processor until smooth. Stir in the sliced serranos.\nCHICKEN: Bring a large pot of water to boil over high heat. When the water reaches a rolling boil, add the chicken breasts, turn heat off, and cover with a tight-fitting lid. Let the chicken cook for 25-30 minutes – while it’s cooking, you can prep the other ingredients. Remove from water, let cool slightly, and shred with two forks. Pour a small amount of the prepared dressing on the chicken to give it flavor and set aside or refrigerate until ready to use.\nNOODLES: Soak the rice noodles in a large bowl of cold water for 15 minutes or until softened. Heat a small amount of the dressing in a large skillet over medium high heat. Add the drained noodles and stir-fry for 5 minutes (I found it helpful to grab the handle and give the pan a good shake every 30 seconds or so). Cut through the noodles with a kitchen scissors if you want them to be shorter and easier to eat.\nVEGETABLES: Cut the carrots into pieces and pulse in a food processor for 10-15 seconds until finely chopped. Shred the cabbage. Mince the cilantro, mint, and green onions.\nASSEMBLY: Toss the chicken, noodles, vegetables, and remaining dressing (to taste) together. Serve immediately.','1 hour','https://pinchofyum.com/wp-content/uploads/Vietnamese-Chicken-Salad-in-bowls-1-183x183.jpg','2025-07-29',60),(1101,'Waffle Berry Stacks','Toast the waffle.\nTop with cottage cheese and fruit.\nDrizzle with honey or sprinkle with sugar.','10 minutes','https://pinchofyum.com/wp-content/uploads/Waffle-Berry-Stacks-recipe-183x183.jpg','2025-07-29',10),(1103,'Warm Balsamic Kale Salad','In a large skillet over medium heat, melt one tablespoon of butter. Add the onions and peppers; saute for several minutes until softened. Add the mushrooms and one tablespoon butter; saute for several minutes until browned.\nAdd the kale, garlic, and balsamic vinegar. Saute until the kale is deep green but not yet wilted. Remove from heat and serve topped with Asiago or Parmesan cheese. Season with salt and pepper to taste.','25 minutes','https://pinchofyum.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/kale-salad-183x183.jpg','2025-07-29',25),(1104,'Whipped Feta Spread','Blend:Place everything in a small blender or food processor. Pulse until smooth and spreadable, with some flecks of feta remaining.\nYou’re Done!Serve on sandwiches, wraps, salads, bowls, burgers, or as a dip! This stuff is delicious.','5 minutes','https://pinchofyum.com/wp-content/uploads/Whipped-Feta.jpg','2025-07-29',5),(1105,'White Cheddar Mac N’ Cheese with Squash and Toasted Walnuts','Cook the squash. Here’s how I did it: Slice up the squash into large pieces and place flesh side down in a large baking or roasting pan (you can really use anything – I used an aluminum cake pan – I don’t have much to work with here in the Philippines). Fill the pan with water so it’s a few inches deep – enough to touch the squash but not cover it completely. Wrap the whole thing with tinfoil and bake at 350 degrees until fork-tender, about an hour. Remove squash from pan and set aside to cool slightly. If you didn’t already toast your walnuts, just stick them on a pan and place in the oven for a few minutes.\nScrape the flesh out and puree it flesh in a blender or food processor. Add 1/2 cup milk to help the mixture puree more smoothly, if necessary. If it’s still too sticky, add a little water. Add the walnuts and puree until smooth. Season generously with salt and pepper.\nCook pasta according to directions. Melt butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add onions – saute for several minutes until onions are golden and translucent. Stir in the squash puree and add the cream cheese. Stir until melted.\nCombine the pasta with the squash sauce, adding vegetable broth as needed to get the right consistency for your sauce. For the white cheddar – stir it in so it melts, or if you prefer, divide it evenly among the bowls and sprinkle on top before serving. Or both.','1 hour 10 minutes','https://pinchofyum.com/wp-content/uploads/white-cheddar-mac-n-cheese-183x183.jpg','2025-07-29',70),(1106,'White Chicken Chili','Bring a large pot of water to boil. Add the chicken breasts and cook for 30 minutes or until cooked through and no pink remains. Drain water; allow chicken to cool. When cool, shred with two forks and set aside.\nCombine the cornmeal and milk in a small bowl and allow mixture to rest as you prepare the soup (the cornmeal will soak up the milk which helps it soften).\nFinely dice the bell peppers, onion, and jalapeno. Melt the butter in a large pot over medium high heat. Add the peppers and onions and sauté until soft, about 8-10 minutes.\nAdd the beans, chicken, broth, and spices to the pot. Stir to combine and bring to a low boil. Cover and simmer for 20-30 minutes.\nAdd the cornmeal and milk mixture. Simmer for another 10 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent burning on the bottom of the pan. Remove from heat and let stand for 10 minutes to thicken.\nTop with sour cream, cilantro, and tortilla chips.','1 hour','https://pinchofyum.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/untitled-191-183x183.jpg','2025-07-29',60),(1111,'Whole Wheat French Toast with Pear Chutney','The night before (if you can! if not, that’s okay, too), place the butter and onion in a small saucepan and saute for several minutes until soft. Add all the other chutney ingredients and bring to a boil. Turn the heat down and simmer for 30-45 minutes, until the mixture is soft, sweet, and thickened into a texture like applesauce. If making ahead, store in the fridge.\nHeat a nonstick pan or griddle over medium high heat. Cut the slices of bread in half so you have a total of 12 bread pieces. Whisk the egg yolks, half and half, milk, vanilla, and flour until smooth. Dip the bread in the egg mixture and transfer to the hot skillet. Fry for a few minutes on each side until golden brown (I don’t recommend using butter – try to use a skillet or griddle that has a very smooth nonstick surface that makes flipping really easy). When the pieces are golden brown, arrange on four plates.\nIf your chutney was made the night before, heat it back up again. Shmear the French toast with a little mascarpone, top with chutney, and sprinkle with pecans. For extra fun, scoop little spoonfuls of mascarpone over the French toast – the heat of the chutney will melt the mascarpone into pretty little pools of creamy and you will be in heaven.','1 hour 5 minutes','https://pinchofyum.com/wp-content/uploads/pear-french-toast-square-183x183.jpg','2025-07-29',65),(1115,'Wild Rice Flatbread','Preheat the oven to 425. Grease a heavy skillet* (cast-iron works well) with olive oil. Spread it with a spatula or spoon so that the bottom and sides are well covered.\nPlace all ingredients in a food processor and process until you have a batter-like consistency (about 30 seconds).\nPour mixture into the preoiled pan. Bake for 15 minutes and remove from oven. Using a spatula, flip the flatbread over and bake for another 15 minutes.**\nCheck doneness and bake for another 5 minutes if needed. You’ll know when it’s done because it starts to pull away from the sides of the pan. Remove from oven, cool, cut, and serve!','35 minutes','https://pinchofyum.com/wp-content/uploads/wild-rice-flatbread-pieces-1024x1024-2-183x183.jpg','2025-07-29',35),(1117,'Winter Rainbow Quinoa Salad','For Mason jar salads, layer in order: 1/2 cup quinoa, 1/2 cup beets, 1/4 cup pomegranate arils, 1 ounce goat cheese, 2 tablespoons pistachios, herbs, 1/2 cup apples, and 1/2 cup spinach. Store in the fridge for as long as 4-5 days. When ready to serve, toss with the dressing.\nIf not making in Mason jars, toss everything together and serve immediately. I also recommend saving some pomegranate arils, crushed pistachios, and crumbled goat cheese to make it look pretty on top. 😀','15 minutes','https://pinchofyum.com/wp-content/uploads/winter-power-quinoa-salad-in-bowl-recipe-1-183x183.jpg','2025-07-29',15),(1119,'World’s Best Watermelon Smoothie','Blend the watermelon and the water until smooth.

Peel the garlic, ginger, and pears. Pulse in a food processor until a paste forms. Add the paste to the meat and stir to combine. Cover everything with soy sauce, brown sugar, and sesame oil – just enough to cover and marinate. Your ratio should be roughly 4 parts soy sauce, 4 parts brown sugar, 1 part sesame oil. Mix it all up and refrigerate for 30 minutes or so.\nRICE:Cook rice according to package directions.\nSAUCE PREP:Whisk all Yum Yum Sauce ingredients together. Set aside.\nMEAT COOKING:Heat a large heavy-duty skillet over very high heat. Discard remaining marinade and add the steak to the pan.
